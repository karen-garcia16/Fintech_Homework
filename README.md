## Overview and Origin

### Name of Chosen Company and General Information

 Alessa a Tier1 Financial Solutions Company
 Alessa was founded in 2006.
 The co-founders of Alessa are Mark Notten and Phil Dias- Current Chief Operating Officer is Andrew Simpson.


* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Alessa focuses on providing compliance and fraud prevention services to various financial industries including insurance, banking, money services businesses, casinos, amongst others. The idea for this type of service came due to the challenges many financial companies faced when it came to meeting compliance and regulatory requirements as well as financial crime prevention. Companies were unwillingly falling into non-compliance and as technology continued to advance, there was a greater risk of fraudulent activities amongst clients and even employees within a company. Alessa also focused on managing financial data to allow a greater access point to all employees/investors which was becoming a struggle for large companies. By developing Alessa, the developers sought to create a platform that would tackle these multiple issues with one service. 


* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Alessa was acquired by Tier1 Financial Solutions which funded the company significantly by equity capital from investors led by Wavecrest Growth Partners, MassMutual Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures. Tier1 Financial Solutions has an approximate funding amount of $34 million. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Alessa's services focus on providing companies with a platform to meet regulatory compliances and prevent financial crimes such as fraud and money laundering. 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Intended customers include any type of company that offers financial/money services such as banks, credit unions, money service businesses such as Moneygram and Western Union, remittance service providers, insurances, etc. Although Alessa's services are tailored to bigger companies at the corporate level, small companies are able to use their services as well.


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Alessa allows its customers to easily detect unusual activity and/or transactions in their stored data. Since Alessa compiles their financial data together, it's easy for the software to detect any anomalies amongst transactions that would otherwise not be caught if they were being manually reviewed. Alessa was also created to be user-friendly to ensure users are able to utilize the software with ease which a lot of their competitors lack. Alessa is also a cloud-based software service which takes away the headache of expensive and confusing hardware installations in a given companies' servers. Solutions within the Alessa software can also be modefied to the unique needs of the company it services based on the organization's needs. Other platforms that offer services like Alessa might not service a variety of financial companies which limits their funding giving Alessa a greater advantage in the market. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
Alessa uses Artificial Intelligence in their analytics to detect complex fraudulent transactions and compliance issues within the server of various departments/systems within one company. It uses machine learning to learn about the processes and actions that have occurred in the past and can learn to make those actions without human interaction. Alessa's cloud based computing capabilities also allow companies using Alessa's transaction monitoring capabilities to enhance their compliance, infrastructure of internal controls to prevent fraudulent activities or schemes, and to monitor regulations. The cloud computing allows the company to use the workflows to automatically identify a high risk transaction and create alerts and send the transaction through appropriate levels of approvals.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Alessa is in the RegTech Domain of the financial industry. 


* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
RegTech is a branch of financial technology that has created innovative solutions to enhance reporting, monitoring, and compliance within the financial services industry. RegTech has focused on developing ways to digitize these compliance processes which has helped companies prevent fraud and stay in compliance. It has also helped employees/regulators to have easier access to reports for both compliance and regulatory monitoring. 


* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Other companies within this domain include Chainalysis, Ascent RegTech, ACA Compliance Group, Accuity, among many others that continue to develop as RegTech becomes more prominent in the FinTech world.



## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Alessa has positively impacted compliance and fraud issues specially within Banks and direct money servicing industries. Banks were often facing non-compliance issues in the past and being hit with costly fines causing issues internally at the corporate level. Alessa has also helped companies stay accountable for all their transactions since it's constantly scanning their systems for issues. It gives companies the opportunity to find and fix their compliance issues with ease with sometimes even the Alessa software fixing it for them. Even though Alessa became tailored to large corporations ever since being acquired by Tier1 Solutions, it is also available for smaller businesses with a less costly option created specifically for them. Alessa has globally impacted the financial community because their services are widely used against the global anti-money laundering intiative. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Metrics used to measure success in this domain include userability, activation metrics, retention metrics, referrals, and technical metrics. Alessa has managed to perform exceptionally well based on these metrics. Alessa offers its product through subscriptions, which would relate to the retention and referral metrics if they are able to effectively retain subscribers and to obtain new subscribers through referrals.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Because of the additional funding Alessa received when acquired by Tier1 Financial Solutions, it currently has a huge advantage over its competitors. The additional funding has allowed Alessa to develop their technology and expand their solutions into a broader market that includes both global and local companies. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
I would actually suggest a mobile component in the software- meaning that they can create an app that allows company officials to view any issues from their mobile devices. Alessa also currently only works with Windows which could be a deal breaker for companies that work with iOS. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This would broaden the platforms that allow users to view/use the software in their preferred devices. It would potentially bring a larger variety of clientel.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
It would utilize app developers and an iOS component to allow the service to work and be viewed from any device.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technolgies are appropriate because this is what the Alessa software currently lacks.
